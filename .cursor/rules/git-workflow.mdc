# Git Workflow

**NEVER run `git commit`, `git push`, or any command that creates commits or pushes to a remote.** The user will always handle commits and pushes themselves.

This includes:
- `git commit` (with any flags)
- `git push` (with any flags)
- `git merge` (if it creates a commit)
- `gh pr create` (pushes to remote)
- Any compound command that includes commit or push

You MAY run read-only git commands such as:
- `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`
- `git add` (staging is acceptable)
- `git branch`, `git stash`
