Clean up preview environments when pull requests close:

```bash
# In CI cleanup job
arcctl env destroy preview-$PR_NUMBER --auto-approve
```

### Batch Cleanup

Clean up multiple preview environments:

```bash
# List and filter preview environments
arcctl env list --output json | \
  jq -r '.[] | select(.name | startswith("preview-")) | .name' | \
  xargs -I {} arcctl env destroy {} --auto-approve
```
