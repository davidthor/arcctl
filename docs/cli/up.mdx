# cldctl up

The `up` command provides a streamlined experience for local development. It deploys your component with all its dependencies to a local environment with minimal configuration.

## Synopsis

```bash
cldctl up [path] [options]
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `[path]` | Path to the component directory (defaults to current directory) |

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-f, --file <path>` | Path to cloud.component.yml if not in default location |
| `-d, --datacenter <name>` | Target datacenter (resolved from flag, `CLDCTL_DATACENTER` env var, or CLI config default) |
| `-n, --name <name>` | Environment name (default: auto-generated from component name) |
| `--var <key=value>` | Set a component variable (repeatable) |
| `--var-file <path>` | Load variables from a file |
| `--detach` | Run in background (don't watch for changes) |
| `--no-open` | Don't open browser to application URL |
| `--port <port>` | Override the port for local access |

## Description

The `up` command is designed for rapid local development. It:

1. **Parses** your `cloud.component.yml` file
2. **Creates** a local development environment
3. **Provisions** all required resources (databases, etc.)
4. **Builds** and deploys your application
5. **Watches** for file changes and auto-reloads
6. **Exposes** routes for local access

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Start from current directory
cldctl up

# Start from specific path
cldctl up ./services/api
```

### With Variables

```bash
# Set variables inline
cldctl up --var log_level=debug --var api_key=test123

# Load variables from file
cldctl up --var-file .env.local
```

### Named Environment

```bash
# Create a named environment (useful for multiple instances)
cldctl up --name my-feature-branch
```

### Background Mode

```bash
# Run in background without watching for changes
cldctl up --detach

# Later, stop the environment
cldctl env destroy my-app-dev
```

## Output

When you run `cldctl up`, you'll see progress for each resource:

```
$ cldctl up

Component: my-app
Environment: my-app-dev (local)

[provision] Creating database "main"...
[provision] Creating database "cache"...
[build] Building deployment "api"...
[deploy] Starting deployment "api"...
[expose] Route "main" available at http://localhost:8080

✓ Application running at http://localhost:8080

Watching for changes... (Ctrl+C to stop)
```

## File Watching

In the default interactive mode, `cldctl up` watches your source files and automatically:

- **Rebuilds** container images when source files change
- **Restarts** deployments with the new images
- **Preserves** database data across restarts

The watch behavior respects `.dockerignore` and common ignore patterns.

## Automatic Dependency Deployment

When your component declares dependencies on other components, `cldctl up` will automatically pull and deploy any that are not already present in the environment. Dependencies are resolved transitively.

If a dependency has required variables without defaults, you will be prompted to enter values:

```
Dependency "shared-db" requires the following variables:

  admin_password (Database admin password) [required]: ********
```

Dependencies already deployed in the environment are skipped.

## Local Environment

The local environment uses:

- **Docker** for running containers
- **Local volumes** for database persistence
- **Port forwarding** for accessing services

Resources are cleaned up when you stop the `up` command (Ctrl+C), unless using `--detach`.

## Comparison with deploy

| Feature | `cldctl up` | `cldctl component deploy` |
|---------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Target | Local development | Any environment |
| Configuration | Minimal | Full control |
| File watching | Yes | No |
| State backend | Local only | Configurable |
| Use case | Development | Staging/Production |
